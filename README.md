### My Process
- Design the Desktop Viewport first, then the Mobile viewport
- Design the grid system, making suer to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Design the border radius, relative positions and z-index of certain elements to match the design
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Create the functions that fecthes the data from the JSON file and bind it into the HTML
- Add animation everytime we call the function that fetches the data

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I Learned
- JavaScript Promise and Fetch
- Fetching from local file needs a live server
